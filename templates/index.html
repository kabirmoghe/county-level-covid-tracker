			<strong><h3>Learn about the spread of COVID-19 in your county</h3></strong>	
			<p>This web app allows you to explore current  across 95% of counties in the United States, barring a few counties with incomplete information. The data used is compiled from USAFacts.org (the source for the CDC's COVID-19 statistics), USDA (demographic data), the CDC (vaccination information), and AARP (social-distanding mandate information). The data on the COVID-19 pandemic includes the current 7-day moving average for cases and deaths per 100,000 as well as up-to-date vaccination information, all on the county level. Along with information on COVID-19, the app includes several other county attributes that may be relevant to the spread of the virus: median household income, unemployment, education, race demographics, and the presence of statewide mask requirements. All of these attributes are up-to-date, and the mask-requirements are updated almost daily.</p>
			<p>To find information about a county, go to the <strong>Data</strong> tab and enter your county (in the form <i>"Your County Name", "Capitalized State Abbreviation"</i>) and select the correct county. To learn about the nationwide situation of COVID-19 on a county-level, go to the <strong>Stats</strong> tab and load data on an aspect of your choice.</p>
